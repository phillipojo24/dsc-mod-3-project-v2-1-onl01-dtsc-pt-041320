    "### For this project I will be using the OSEMiN framework, wich stands for Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model and Interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain: The dataset consists of car data belonging to 24,000 instanceses and was downloaded from the Kaggle Datasets Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scrub: I will search for null values and outliers to replace them with more suitable values or delete them form the data set. I will also loo at multicollinearity issues amongst the features and find creative ways to deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore: Throughout the whole process, it is important to lookout for other important information that can be gathered from the data. I will carry out Exploratory Data Analysis and answer relevant questions about the current state of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model: I will use single and ensemble binary classification models. The aim of the project is to select the best performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters to achieve correct identification of revenue generating sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpret: Interpret the results of the models to make recommendations that generate value."
